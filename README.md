Software development lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

In this project, I learned that interpreting user needs starts with clear communication and empathy for the end user. Instead of jumping straight into coding, we begin with user stories that described what the user wanted and why. This format helps translate requests into concrete, testable feature by breaking the user’s goal into a focused outcome.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

This project taught me to approach development iteratively and collaboratively. Instead of trying to deliver everything at once, break the work into sprints while tackling the highest-priority features first and use regular feedback to improve the product.

I plan to carry forward several Agile processes:
Sprint planning: to break work into manageable goals
Daily stand-ups: for check ins and surface blockers early
Backlog refinement: to ensure we are always working on what matters most
Retrospectives: to reflect and continuously improve my process

These practices not only improve the quality of the software but also reduce stress and make the development process feel more humanane.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating openly, being reliable, and adapting to team needs. Whether I was acting as a developer, product owner, or Scrum Master, success came from mutual respect and clear coordination. A good team member contributes their strengths while also creating space for others to do the same. This is especially true in Agile where trust and collaboration drive the entire workflow.
